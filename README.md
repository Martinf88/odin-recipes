This project demonstrates that i can create a basic webpage using HTML5, linking to other pages and write professional commit messages.

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course. I already knew the basics before taking this course but i figured that it would'nt hurt to repeat in case TOP teaches things my education missed.
